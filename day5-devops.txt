linux directory structure:

/ --- ROOT Directory

boot/ --> having all booting files
etc/  --> all the configuration files
bin/  --> all the executable files like ls,touch,cat etc
var/  --> variable data --> mostly consists of logs
tmp/  --> temporary files
home/ --> ur workspace

cd /home/linux --> cd for change directory

ssh -i devops.pem -l ec2-user IP address

pwd --present working directory

cd / -->rootdirectory -->how to verify by using pwd.

cd /var	-> ls --> cd log --> pwd

cd /var/--(followed by hit double tab)--u will see all the list of directories(ending by /).

cd var/l followed by double tab. -- list all the things that are started by l.

cd - --> it will takes u to the previous directory.

$mkdir demo
cd demo --> relative path
pwd
one directory before means--> cd ..
cd ~ -->home directory

in linux .(dot denotes present working directory) ..(denotes parent directory)

================================================================
directories:
create:mkdir
remove:
rename:mv sample1 sample2
copy:cp sample1 sample2


cp file fileexist,filedoesnt exists
	overwrite, copy with the same name. if its a directory it will place inside the directory.

cp sample2 demo1/samplex
copies in samplex.

in linux if u remove a file u can't retreive.


mv file fileexist,filedoesnt exists
	overwrite, rename the file. if its a directory it will move inside the directory.


===================================================================

now editor part:

linux is not a flavour of unix at all..most stupid statement.
linux tornaldo -- came into picture -- with an intention of make an os.
and they found unix is the best .. so rubust and secure.
however the unix works the same the linux tornoldo written the linux.

both are completely different.
some people will feel that... unix has ls....and linux has same command.. he has written the same utility.

======================================================================

vi / vim 

sudo vi /etc/sudoers --no colours
sudo vim /etc/sudoers -- with colors..will grap attention and makes things easy write.

it won't esc mode u need to understand. (down if it is insert then insert mode, if it is colon then colon mode)

GNU

linux to linux vi editor options will change.

3 modes:

ESC MODE:by default we will be in default mode

INSERT MODE: by pressing i when we can go for insert mode .... if u want to back the press escape mode  
COLON MODE:  by pressing : ---> it is used to (:/search,:/replace,save,save and quite)

2 suitations:
if file exists:it loads the file
if file doesn't exists:it will create a new file

==============================================================================

cp /etc/passwd .
vim passwd
to search content-- esc -- :/nologin
search & replace -- esc -- :%s/nologin/NOLOGIN/         %s/what u want to search/what u want to replace/   :2s/nologin/NOLOGIN/ --> only on the second line replace, % stands for all lines
1-5s/nologin/NOLOGIN/ -- one to 5 lines.

:/user ---first user replaced second user coundn't (it checks only first possibility) therefore use g at the end:%s/user/USER/g --replaces every word in the line.

:/User/ --case sensitive ---- command :set ic  ----------- now case will go off
disable the feature:set noic

case insenstive
:%s/user/USER/gi --i caseinsensitive
save :wq!

! --forcefully quite
q!-- quite without saving any changes.
